# Inside there
There are something inside...
## Documents
Here, there are few documents about programming language that you can find inside this repository.
### C++
C++, or C plus plus, is an extension to C. Current documents are verified and tested in Code::Blocks or Visual Studio and even DevC++ by Bloodshed. (Turbo C++ are too old and unsupported.)

Current C++ version (revision) is 17. In 2020, it will be C++20 and not revision 17.
### C
C, or C++ predecessor, is a high-level programming language, like C++.

C however, rendering 2D image faster than C++ while rendering 3D in C is not good. C++ is faster in scientific and 3D program or even rendering software.
### Assembly
Assembly is a low-level language. Assembly is created by J. Wheeler created Assembly language.
## Excluded language (few)
### Python
Python is also a high-level programming language, but why?

A result has show in number calculation, Python slower than C++ (note C++ is slower than C) 50-100 times.

A Quora replies show:
---------------------------------------------
In C:
- load the integer from location a
- load the integer from location b
- perform integer addition
- store the resulting integer into location c
Total: 4 CPU commands
 
In Python:
- load the object from location a
- load the object from location b
- find the __add__ method in object a
- ... hashtable magic here ...
- perform type checks and do the necessary type casting for object b
- if you can't find an appropriate representation for b, throw an exception
- extract the integer value from object a
- extract the integer value from object b
- perform integer addition
- allocate new memory
- wrap the resulting value in a new object
Total: a few hundred CPU commands.

Objective: c = a + b
